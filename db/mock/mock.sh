mockgen -help
# mockgen has two modes of operation: source and reflect.

# Source mode generates mock interfaces from a source file.
# It is enabled by using the -source flag. Other flags that
# may be useful in this mode are -imports and -aux_files.
# Example:
# 	mockgen -source=foo.go [other options]

# Reflect mode generates mock interfaces by building a program
# that uses reflection to understand interfaces. It is enabled
# by passing two non-flag arguments: an import path, and a
# comma-separated list of symbols.
# Example:
# 	mockgen database/sql/driver Conn,Driver
